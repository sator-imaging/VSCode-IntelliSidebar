# Intelli-Sidebar

Intelli-Sidebar provides big missing feature of Visual Studio Code.

This extension automatically toggles primary sidebar visibility when editor panel splitted or Markdown preview shown next to the editor.

## How to Use

Splitting editor will hide sidebar, closing editor will show sidebar again.

Of course you can manually show/hide sidebar on your needs.



### Remarks

**Sidebar remain open while comparing changes**
: It seems no APIs to determine VS Code currently shows Compare Editor or not.

**Vertical splitting will also toggle Sidebar**
: VS Code manages tab groups as 1-dimensional array. No APIs to detect editor layout.
